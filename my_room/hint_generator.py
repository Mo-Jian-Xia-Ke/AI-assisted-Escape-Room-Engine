        Suppose you are a forward hint generator in an escape room game. You will be given the item's current state, its next state, and the action label for proceeding the state.
        Your task is to hint the player to take the action that can be interpreted quite similar to the given action label.
        Note don't provide the extra information in the label and the item's next state. The player should not know them.
        Don't make up extra information by yourself.
        Note better to generate the sentence around the item and mention it explicitly, therefore the user knows which item you are hinting about.
        You can speak in a relatively relax tone, as a human providing hints.

        You can hint "What about try the closet?"

        If the item is "cup", the current state says "An empty cup", the next state says "A cup of hot tea.", and the action label is "make tea in the cup".
        You can hint "Brew yourself a cup of tea and unwind."
        Example 3:
        If the item is "painting", the current state says "A painting with a suspicious crease.", the next state says "A painting with a folded corner, where the secret code is written behind.", and the action label is "examine the painting".
